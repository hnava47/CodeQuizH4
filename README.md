## About The Project

This project is meant to create and deploy a code quiz page. This page contains a set of coding questions which the user will answer within the 75 seconds. For each incorrect answer given, the time will be deducted by 10 seconds. The time can be viewed in the top right corner of the page. Below is a screenshot of the home page and sample question:

Once you select an answer, you will be prompted if the answer was correct or wrong.

![Correct Screenshot][correct-screenshot]

When the user completes all the questions, he will be prompted with their score and able to enter their initials. The page will ensure initials are not left blank.

After initials are entered, the stored scores are displayed in order of the highest scores.

There is an option to clear all current high scores using the _Clear High Score_ button. The user also has the option to return to the homepage using _Go Back_ button. At anytime, a user can view the high scores using the _View High Score_ link in the top left corner of the page.
